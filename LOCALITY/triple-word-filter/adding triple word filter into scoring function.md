triead adding it with scaling factor 0.2

for each common word - remember all possible triples and check.

huge improvement immediately.

90:8.7 (0.67)

trying to increase factor, i may be onto something

factor 0.35:

85:3.6 (0.67)
88:5 (0.65)
91:8.0 (0.63)

RESULTS: great success.

factor 0.5:

87:3.6 (0.63)
92:7.8 (0.59)

factor 1:

93:6.5 (0.5)

factor \infty

90 : 3.4 (0.2)
92.2 : 4.7 (0.19)
90 : 3 (0.22)
85 : 1.4 (0.25)
93:6 (0.17)
93:5.7 (0.18)
91:3.4 (0.21)



wait... lets play with token amount. scale up to 5000:

90:2.5 (0.21)
91.8 : 3.5 (0.19)

RESULT: improvement.

scaleup time. 10,000 tokens!

91: 2.9 (0.19)
92:3.7 (0.18)
89:2.1 (0.21)

RESULT: no significant improvement.

scaledown time: 7500 tokens.

90:2.3 (0.2,0.21)
91:3.2 (0.19)

0.21 with 7500 will from now on be the accepted value.
for lesser false negative values, amount of tokens needs to be raised to 10,000.

worked... insanely well.
