first of all - noticed that all some of the wrong sentences contain gibberish words, while others contain mainly words that make sense.

thus' a logical first step is to filter away strings that are made of unrecognised words in the english language!

experimentation in word-filter folder.

now we need to actually think. we need to somehow determine what word combinations are legal, and actually think of the syntax.
